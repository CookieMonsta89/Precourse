Variable= a variable holds a value.  Picture it as a storage container that we use to hold information.  
We can open these storage containers at a later time to recall something whether it be a number or 'string' which can be something like 'goodbye'.  

String= a string can be 0 or more letters, numbers or characters and these are written inside of quotes.  For example: "Joe Stanfield". 

Functions= function is a lot like a formula.  At 12 years old, you are likely in the seventh grade.  Therefore, you are somewhat familiar with formulas
used in mathematics.  Functions work a lot like a formula in math except the data inside the functions don't change.  

if statement= an if statement runs a block of code and gives a specified return statement.  For example, your mother asks IF you have cleaned your room,
you would return information you set in the if statement. This could be a simple yes or no or it could be more complicated.    

Boolean values= this data type will ONLY return one of two values (true or false).  For example, your teacher asks you if 11 is equal to 8.  
You would say no (false).  Or is 10 less than 22, you would say yes (true).
