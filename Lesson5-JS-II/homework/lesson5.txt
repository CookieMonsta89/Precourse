for= for an example, lets say you had to complete a homework assignment for your English class. 
    Your teacher tells you that afer writing your assignment, you must proof read that assignment 
    10 times or until you find a mistake, whichever comes first.  With a for loop, the loop will 
    run a designated amount of times or until it finds what we are looking for, which in your case, 
    would be a mistake in your assignment.  

&&= this operator is used when we are setting parameters for something.  For example, your parents 
    tell you that you need to go through your room and get rid of some of your toys as you have too many.
    Your parents tell you that you can keep any toy that you have gotten in the past year AND (&&) that you 
    have actually used in that past year.  This means you can't keep a toy just because you have received it 
    in the past year.  It has to meet both requirements.

||= This operator can be explained using the same scenario as before.  Your parents tell you to throw out 
    some of your toys.  Their rules are that you have to have recieved the toy in the past year OR (|| notice 
    that it's OR not AND) that you have used in the past year.  We would use this in javascript to return a statement 
    when defining the parameters of an if statement. 

!= This operator stands for not equal.  You would use this when you are trying to state that something is not equal to another.  
    This operator will compare apples to oranges where an operator like !== will compare only apples to other apples.  In this 
    example, apples and oranges represent numbers and strings.
