Callback function = javascript is a very event driven language.  What I mean by this is that, 
    instead of running a function then moving onto the next, it listens for other events/functions.  
    Lets use changing a tire as an example.  There are multiple parts to changing a tire.  First you must jack
    the car off of the ground, then loosen the lug nuts, then remove lug nuts, remove tire, place new tire on, tighten lug nuts
    and lastly lower jack.  Well you could create all of these actions as seperate functions to be completed.  The only problem is, 
    there is no gaurantee that javascript would complete them in the correct order.  That is why we would create all of these functions
    inside of another function.   That way, we can control the order in which they functions are completed.
