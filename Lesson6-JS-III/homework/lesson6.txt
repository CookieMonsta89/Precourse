array= array is a special variable that can hold more than one value at a time.  The simplest way I 
know how to explain is to compare it to a bookshelf.  The bookshelf will be our array.  We will name the 
array "bookshelf".  Inside of our array "bookshelf" we have books with all different values or names.  
These value/books can be in any order you would like for them to be in and we can always add more books 
or take away more books.  An array is similar to this as it holds values that can be added, deleted or grabbed at anytime.
