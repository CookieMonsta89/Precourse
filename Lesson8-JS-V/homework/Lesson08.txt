constructor = Constructors are used when working with objects.  I have used the example of a car as an object before
    so I will stick with that.  Lets say we are a car lot and we have hundreds of the same car and we have created one object named car already.
    On the object we have given it properties such as color, make, model, etc.  We are a toyota dealership so we primarily have toyota vehicles but there are
    a few differences in them.  Instead of creating new objects by hand, we could use a constructor to grab the generic properties from an object but allows us to 
    change or create new properties in our new object.  


Prototype = every object in javascript has a prototype.  This is the idea that objects inherit their properties from other objects.  Think of it this way, a prototype is 
    a pointer to another object.  If you try to look up a key on an object and it is not found, Javascript will look next at the objects prototype until it returns a null.  
    Lets say your are looking for a car in your toyota dealership that is red.  Javascript will look through the objects until it finds one with the property value of red.  
    If none return, it will return null.
