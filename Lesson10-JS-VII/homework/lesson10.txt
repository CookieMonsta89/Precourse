Closure = this refers to the 'reach' that a function has.  For example, 
    a function can access all variable that are defined inside of itself 
    and a function can also access variables defined outside of that function.  
    But the inner function cannot call on arguments object.  Lets say you create a function, 
    inside of the function, you create another function.  The first function cannot call on 
    inner functions variables but the second function inside of the first can call upon the outer functions
    variables.
